Hi,
We reserved a limo for a Bachelorette Party on July 31st. I wanted to write to tell you how pleased all of us were with our driver, Eric Gut. He was a Gentleman and was just so fantastic! We really appreciated all he did for us and for getting all of us home safely. It was an excellent experience. <pre></div>

This email is being written by Jan Wallace (MOB to Robyn  
Wallace)....it is being directed to Advantage Limo...but specifically,  
to lend kudos of appreciation and professionalism to your driver, DAN  
LASKO.

Michelle at Dramatic Events contacted your firm to set up March 23 as  
the date to pick up the bride and some of her wedding party in  
Thornton, CO...for tripping out to three wedding dress sights and  
lunch at the Elephant Walk.  Dan drove the limo on what turned into a  
weather-wise God-awful day with wet snow and more snow...but a  
fantastic day for the bride and her retinue!  Dan not only got us  
timely to all appointments...but was so gracious in seating and  
unseating us, addressing our Starbuck desires, and even "coat  
challenging" while the snows fell!

Dan made our day the momentous one that it was...and to him, I say  
thank you.  To your agency, I applaud not only the price we had for  
the day's adventures, but also the cleanliness and appropriateness of  
the limo sent for the outing.  You have our vote!  I am certain when  
we do head into CO again for the wedding....your agency will be the  
one that we contact.

Thanks to you and to Dan Lasko...for making our day wonderful!

SIncerely,  Jan Wallace (Mrs. James N. Wallace)

Hey Janet - just wanted to send a note to say thank you for such a

fantastic.  He did such a great job helping with the surprise and my

Hello Mr. Carwin, I want to thank you for the fine service we received from your driver Kevin this weekend.

The car was clean and was just what we hoped for. I will happily recommend your service to my friends in the future and want to thank you for sending Kevin as our driver. Sincerely, Don<pre></div>

I just wanted to let you know what a great job Kenny did for us on Sunday evening.  He was at our home promptly at 5:00 and pick up my daughter and her friends for a ride about town before dinner.  He did an outstanding job, and the girls had a great time.  They found a park and he very graciously took pictures of them having fun.  He dropped them off at the Melting Pot precisely at 6:00 and then even returned later when my daughter had forgotten her camera case in the back seat.  Thank you so much for making my daughter's 18th birthday so incredibly special.  I will definitely recommend you to my friends.

I want to take this opportunity to thank you for the first class service you provided our families this past weekend (Oct 4).  The Rolls Royce was an absolutely amazing vehicle and first class transportation for the bride and groom.  They, and our guest, were amazed!  It added such an elegant touch to the occasion.  The bride and groom loved the Rolls driver!  He made their experience fun and special!  All of your drivers were amazing!!  Thank you SO MUCH for your first class service.  Words really cannot express my gratitude.  You helped make our wedding celebration perfect and flawless!  Thank you, Bev <pre></div>

Mr. Carwin,
 Hello, I am writing to you as very satisfied customer! We booked our limo excursion with your company about 3 1/2 weeks ago and from the first conversation, we have been very pleased! The employee who booked our reservation was very helpful and took the time to answer all of our questions.
Mike or "Mr. Mike" as our passengers called him was amazing. He showed up 20 minutes early and was very professional and patient from the start. He treated us with the up most respect and really made our "party" feel special. The limo was absolutely spotless and was decorated inside with more than I could have ever wished for. Mike was extremely patient and always made us feel like we were very important customers. Mike went out of his way to make our special day amazing!
What I haven't told you yet, is that we had reserved this limo for our daughters sixth birthday party! The limo was the highlight to our baby girls party. Mike made this happen. He treated our little princess like royalty and was so kind, patient and respectful to the needs of seven super hyper and excited six year old girls.
 I am extremely impressed with Mikes professionalism and sincerity and I will use your company and request Mike often in the future! This was a huge hit with the little girls and your phone number was given out to five out of the six parents because the girls has SO much fun!
I can honestly say that I have never received such great customer service nor have I been more pleased with a company as I am yours, and believe me, I can be very hard to please when it comes to my children!
Mike deserves a HUGE pat on the back, at least, and he should be a role model for all employers trying to establish a repeat customer base!

Very satisfied customers,
Kevin and Anna

We wanted to say thank you to your entire staff for the wonderful service that we received from A Advantage Limousine on our recent rental of your 24 passenger Excursion.  We appreciated that fact that we were able to come down to your office prior to renting and view the limousine that we were considering; thank you Gary for taking the time to show us the Excursion.

We also wanted to thank Kevin, the driver, for the great service that he provided to all of the kids.  I know that all of the parents who were at our home on the day of the pickup really appreciated Kevin talking to the kids about the rules and for also having the parents stay and listen to them as well.  Please let Kevin know that all of the kids wanted to thank him for the great time that they had and for making Prom night special for all of them.

Once again, thank you for everything.  We will definitely use A Advantage Limousine again and will definitely recommend your company to others.

Sincerely,

The Anderson Family <pre></div>

We wanted to thank your entire staff for helping make our wedding day at the Arrowhead Golf Club in Littleton on September 1st so special.
After hearing many horror stories about limousine companies, it was so comforting to have a service as professional as A Advantage. Your drivers were courteous, friendly on-time which helped make our day go smoothly.
The vehicles were state of the art and well maintained.
Your prices were also extremely reasonable and fair for the services you provided.
Thank you for the professionalism. I would not hesitate to recommend you to any friend or family member for their special occasion.

Sincerely,
Alanna

I wanted to write to inform you of the excellent and unsurpassed service that my Fiancée and I received from A Advantage Limousine Service and our wonderful driver Roche. It all started Monday, the week of the event, when Roche gave me a call before I could call him. At that moment, I knew I had picked the right company for my special event.
On the day of the engagement, my nerves were frayed. I had an appointment with Roche at 12:15 I was happy to see him around the corner in front of the Brown Palace 5 minutes early. This helped to calm my nerves, and reassured me that Roche had everything covered for the rest of the day.
My Fiancée informed me that Roche was very professional and had exquisite manners. Every destination was made on time, and with wonderful elegance and style. The Rolls Royce was in cherry condition and made you feel like royalty as you drove down the road with people taking pictures and screaming. Roche had everything planned, to every detail. From the red carpet service, to the champagne being corked after the proposal, he had thought of everything. He felt like part of the family as the night came to a close. So much so, that my Fiancée said
"Do we have to say good bye?"
I was so thoroughly impressed with A Advantage Limousine Service and Roche, that I can't wait to book another event with this company. I would definitely recommend A Advantage Limousine Service for your special event. We did, and we could not have imagined a better ending to a memorable day. Thank you A Advantage, and thank you Roche from the bottom of our hearts.

Respectfully,
Tony and McKenzie<pre></div>

Hi,

I recently hired your company for my wedding on August 19th and just wanted to give you some feedback about the service we received.

Your company was by far one of the best vendors on my wedding day. I can’t quite remember the name of our driver, but he did a fantastic job (it was a unique name, like Roche or something similar???) Our driver went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and happy through our entire trip. After the ceremony, it was pouring down rain, and I was quite grumpy about having to walk to the limo in my nice satin white dress. The driver came to the rescue with a huge umbrella. He covered me up and walked me from the door of the church to the limo, leaving me completely dry—even though he got drenched. He even decorated the limo with cute white wedding bells and balloons that said Just Married. He added so many nice touches that really made our day special.

In the future, anytime I am in need of a limo company, I will definitely give your company a call. And I will refer you to all my friends who will be getting married within the next few years.

Thank you so much for your outstanding service!!

Carol<pre></div>

To Whom it May Concern

I worked with your wonderful staff this past weekend. They were so helpful and punctual, which made everything flow smoothly.
Our driver Kenny was courteous, safe, and easy to work with. I knew I could trust him to make sure everyone got to their destination on-time and without incident. As a wedding coordinator, I appreciate venders who go above and beyond, treat my clients well, and deliver quality service. Therefore, I will be happy to refer Advantage Limo in the future.

All my best,
Nilufer

Hello,
I am the teacher at Arvada West High School who had the pleasure of taking the stretch hummer to the Crush game with my students a couple of weeks ago. I just wanted to say thank you for a wonderful trip! Everything was set up perfectly for the kids - the pop, the music and the environment in general. Dan was extremely patient and friendly with my students. The photograph that he gave us was a really nice touch- (it turned out to be the only picture we have of the entire group so we are making copies for everyone.) Thanks again for adding to a terrific day!

Janet:  I just wanted to drop a note to say thank you for the tremendous service we received for our night out on Dec. 31.  The driver was prompt, courteous and professional.  And, the limo was perfect.  I will certainly recommend your service. 

Sincerely,

Lori

Chris,

Just wanted to send a note to say a BIG THANK YOU to you and your team for all the support you provide us over the last week!  I can't tell you how much I appreciate you, the office staff and all of your drivers (whom I actually had a chance to meet!)  You have a great team of professionals and I'm a very satisfied client!

Hello A Advantage Limo Service

I just wanted to tell you that we had the best driver for our Haunted House tour on Friday, the 28th of October. His name was Ryan and he treated us like royalty! We really enjoyed ourselves and plan on doing this again next year. You run a terrific service.

Thank you,
Brooke<pre></div>

Dear Mr. Carwin
I tried to call you today to just let you know what a great job Chuck did for us last Saturday evening. My daughter had a truly memorable homecoming experience. The young people all told me how nice Chuck was and how he made everything special. I didn't think that I would be able to afford the limousine service for the entire evening, but you all made it work for me and I just want you to know that I appreciate it.

I called in to your office severel times to discuss the plan for the evening. Everyone I talked to in your office was very friendly and helpful.

Thanks so much! Please pass our appreciation to Chuck.

Sincerely, Sheryl<pre></div>

I just wanted to express our thanks for the wonderful job that your company did for our wedding this past weekend (Rolls Limo to Lionscrest).  The driver arrived early, was extremely helpful with luggage, and my daughter reported that the whole experience was "awesome." 

We will certainly recommend your company to our friends and family.

Best regards,  Mary<pre></div>

Good Morning :-)

Just a quick note to say "thanks" for always providing excellent service and exceeding expectations.

This is Scott H - for the past 4 years, I have used your service to take my mom and I to DIA for our annual Christmas vacation to Las Vegas. You have always been on time with immaculate limos and Janet has always provided a friendly face for the excitement of leaving and something to look forward to when returning as well as providing a stress-free means of getting to/from the airport.

Last night I had used your service to take my mom, girlfriend and me to the Tom Jones concert at the Pavilion. With Janet on vacation, our driver was Steve and Steve provided the same excellent level of service we have come to expect from your company. Steve was on-time (early actually), with an immaculate limo stocked with ice and necessary mixers, smoothly drove us to the Pepsi Center/Pavilion and was waiting out front when the concert was over. Steve's pleasant demeanor and friendly attitude, along with smooth driving and dead-on punctuality made the evening very special for us.

These days excellent service is, unfortunately, the exception and not the standard and people take the time to complain but rarely take the time to compliment and recognize a job well-done. I feel that companies like yours, and people like Janet and Steve deserve a pat on the back when my expectations are met/exceeded on a regular basis.

Anyway - GREAT JOB again and I look forward to doing business with you again in the near future and definitely in December for the Las Vegas Christmas trip.

Cheers :-)

Chris,
I wanted to let you know how pleased we were with your Limousine service today.  Our driver was very professional, anticipated our needs, and took great care of our group.  If Chad is just one example of your staff, you are heads above any other service around.<pre></div>

Dear friends at A Advantage Limousine
I was referring a friend of mine to your company, as I always do! I was showing him all your limousines on the web site, and telling him how great the service is. I came across a page customers thoughts and referrals, and it dawned on me I have never told you how I feel. I came to your company after using almost every large limousine service in the Denver area! I'll never forget my thoughts the next day, I felt somebody really does care about customer service which is very rare today. Then I thought maybe it was just a fluke. Well after two years and some 15 events later I can say, you've never been late, always your vehicle's have been clean and well maintained, not to mention the coolest and most unique, but it still comes down to the staff. They're always happy to help in anyway they can! I have to admit sometimes a call to say Hi!
You have what you say you have!
You do what you say you'll do!
Simply The best!!! Why would anybody use anyone else!!!
Your FREE salesman Bob<pre></div>

Thank you! Thank you!
For being such a good sport at Wild Basin last Saturday. You maneuvered your "Loooooong limo" with precision on the narrow and windy road.
 I truly appreciate your positive attitude and "go for it" style.
You've got my recommendation!
Cheers! Cheryl

Just dropping you a line to thank-you for making our Christmas Eve so magical.  My guests had a wonderful time and our tour was the talk of Christmas Day.  This is something that they will be talking about for quite awhile.  We certainly appreciated the kindness and thoughtfulness of our drivers.  We look forward to doing this again next year and each following year when we have guests in.  I just can't tell you how much we enjoyed ourselves.  Thank-you and we wish you the happiest of holidays.  May the New Year bring you much Success!!

I just wanted to drop you a quick line to let you know what a great time we had the other night, and to commend Kevin as our driver. He arrived 15 minutes early, went over the paperwork and took care of getting the champagne ready. He took the time to decorate the interior with balloons, streamers and a banner, and let the teenagers get in and check it out for fun! He was kind, courteous and accommodating. All of us enjoyed our "limo" experience! We will definitely use your services in the future and will highly recommend you to our family and friends. Thank you for helping me have a fabulous 50th birthday bash with my friends!

Thank you all again for a wonderful experience. My daughter loved the surprise limo and the 23 of us enjoyed our ride downtown. Mike was extremely friendly and accommodating...the limo was lovely and the champagne was enjoyed by all! Thanks again for letting us have the Excursion for the one hour. After two events with your company, I'd never use another one in Colorado. Sincerely, Donna F<pre></div>

Dear A Advantage
I am writing in regards to one of your limousine drivers that was our chaperone last night, I wanted to comment on the excellent service we were provided and to send thanks to all who made our wedding night a special one. Forgive me for not having a last name but, he simply went by Ed throughout the course of the evening. Thanks to Ed for a fabulous evening and for his excellent service and attention to detail. It is greatly appreciated and I will recommend your company to friends and family in the future!

Once again, thank you for the wonderful experience and job well-done.

Hi Larry –

I am the day-of coordinator that Steve & Sara had hired for their wedding this past Saturday, August 23rd.2003  I just wanted to inform you of the excellent service that Paul, your driver, provided to us.  He was on time (and, a little early), dressed professionally, very courteous and understanding with all of the transportation needs (we made several trips back and forth between the Cathedral & The Brown Palace).  Plus, your vehicle was in immaculate condition!  Thanks for everything and hopefully I can work with your company again in the near future –
