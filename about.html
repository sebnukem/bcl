			<h3>Our limousine fleet speaks louder than words</h3>

			<p>We believe we have the complete fleet in Denver, but that's not all.
All of our limousines are licensed for DIA. Only PUC licensed limousines are allowed on the 5th level, and only chauffeurs with a security badge are allowed past the concrete barrier. All limousines are required to be on the 5th level only! If a company says they will pick you up anywhere else, BEWARE! All limos have E-470 transponders for fast access.
			<p>

			<div class="licences">
			<p>Licensed by the state of Colorado. Fully insured.</p>

	 		<p>Member of the NLA National Limousine Association.</p>

			<p>Licensed by the <a href="http://www.dora.state.co.us/pls/real/PUC_Permit.Search_Form">Colorado P.U.C.</a></p>

			<p><span class="bls">Boxcars Limo Service</span> DOT # US DOT 1119479 CO<br>
			<small>All limousines over 14 passengers are required to have a DOT number.</small>
			</p>
			</div>

			<h3>Legal authorization to operate in Colorado</h3>

			<p>The Colorado Public Utilities Commission (PUC) regulates the luxury limousine industry to ensure we are operating within their guidelines and regulations. There are some companies that are not licensed and don't conform to the policies of the PUC. Always make sure the limousine company you choose is licensed and in good standing with the PUC, or you will fine yourself in a bind, when they get caught!<br>
			<small>To check on us, as well as any other limousine licenses in Colorado, <a href="http://www.dora.state.co.us/pls/real/PUC_Permit.Search_Form">click here</a>, scroll down to the box marked Type of Permit, click on Luxury Limousines, don't add anything else, then click Submit Permit Query button.</small>
			</p>

			<h3>Our fleet is fully insured for $1,500,000.00</h3>

			<p>The Colorado Public Utilities Commission requires $1,000,000 insurance per limousine, there are a lot of companies in Denver that don't carry this coverage. They can get away with this until they get in an accident. At <span class="bls">Boxcars Limo Service</span>, we pay more because we have the largest limousines in Colorado, we will not be under insured!
			</p>

			<h3>Ski racks / cargo carriers for extra luggage</h3>

			<p>Available for most SUV limousines.<br>
		    Window ski racks for Lincoln limousines.<br>
			Car seats for youths up to 80 lbs.
			</p>

			<h3>Weather Related Airport Closures</h3>

			<p>During the winter months, travelers often have to complete their trips to mountain resorts by ground transportation when flights are canceled due to inclement weather. <span class="bls">Boxcars Limo Service</span> can get you where you need to go because we have vehicles that are equipped with four-wheel drive capability. To add to your comfort we provide non-alcoholic beverages and a video entertainment center to help pass the time.
			</p>

			<h3>On Time Performance</h3>

			<p>Your time is valuable and we don't want you waiting on us. Our policy is to have a car at the pick up site within 15 minutes prior to the scheduled time. Our chauffeurs have years of experience in the industry and know Denver and the surrounding areas. They know the quickest routes to get you where you are going and alternative routes to get around unexpected traffic jams or road construction.</p>

			<h3>Technology</h3>

			<p>LIMO WIZ - software computer scheduling program simply the best in the business.<br>
Teletrac - Fleet director, knows where our limos are at all times, safe and productive around the clock.<br>
In house web master.

We never process it ahead of time unless you would prefer that. We provide monthly billing statements for companies that prearrange an open account with itemized invoices.
